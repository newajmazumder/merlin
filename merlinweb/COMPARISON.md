# Comparison: Custom Clone vs Real Scraped Site

### 1. Custom-Built Clone (merlin_clone/)
**What it is:** A recreated version I built from scratch
- ✅ Fully functional HTML/CSS/JS
- ✅ All interactions work
- ✅ No dependencies
- ✅ Easy to customize
- ❌ Not the exact original code

### 2. Real Scraped Site (real_merlin_scrape/)
**What it is:** Actual website files from merlin.computer
- ✅ 100% original source code
- ✅ Exact Next.js build
- ✅ Real images and assets
- ❌ Requires web server
- ❌ Some features need backend
